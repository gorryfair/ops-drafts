      "body": "The guidance recommend that server generated connection IDs should include a crytographic MAC when being used for load balancing. This sounds like a good suggestion in principal, but the Connection ID is 64bits in size, I'm not a cryptographer but I don't see how this is possible - if it is possible then it perhaps would be good to include guidance within the documents?\r\n\r\nMy logic is as follows (hopefully I've made a mistake/misunderstood the concept somewhere)\r\n\r\nAs a CDN operator I'd probably want to segment the connection ID into 4 spaces:\r\nPOP id|machine id|unique connection|MAC\r\n\r\nYou could combine your POP id and machine ID into a single space but it is likely to be beneficial to have two tiers, the POP routes the request to the right general location and the machine id then identifies a machine within that space. Other ways to split this are also possible.\r\n\r\nIf 12 bits are used for POP id that would give 4096 distinct locations. Trends to deploy deeper into networks (particularly within mobile/cell base stations) doesn't make this number totally infeasible .\r\nIf 8 bits are then used for a machine id within a POP that gives 256 possible machines. \r\n\r\nThis means 20 bits might be used for load balancing purposes. This gives a bit (lot?) of room for flexibility and it is unlikely all million combinations are used but it is probably the right order of magnitude for a large widely distributed CDN (even if we drop down to 16 bits it doesn't significantly impact the analysis below).\r\n\r\nThe actual unique connection pool needs to be large enough to avoid repeating too quickly - even if you have a lot of clients taking advantage of 0RTT to aggressively close/re-open connections. There also presumably needs to be some randomization of the ids so that they aren't created sequentially. I've assumed 24 bits (which is only 16 million unique ids per server).\r\n\r\nThis only leaves 20 bits left for the MAC, that is about 1 million possible values. As I've said I'm not a cryptographer but to me this looks small enough that a brute force attack guided by some valid inputs might be feasible even on relatively low power machines? \r\n\r\nFor that matter isn't a simple replay attack feasible? The MAC can't be based upon the full 5-tuple as we need to support connection mobility. You could embed a timestamp into the id somewhere to protect against this but that would use up even more bits, otherwise you could slowly gather up valid (but presumably closed) connection ids and then aggressively replay them all in a short time period.",

The only reason I see to have a MAC at all is to make it harder for an attacker to mount an effective attack on a single backend using your routing infrastructure for steering.  QUIC as a protocol is resilient to man-on-a-side attack vector (except during handshake), so attackers guessing valid connection IDs is not a big deal.\r\n\r\nThe key is to have enough entropy (\"unique connection\" size) so you do not accidentally create duplicate connection IDs.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to include at least a bit that identifies the key used (since you'll want to do key rotation).",

Using Alt-Svc, the server is able to pick and advertise any port number and a compliant client will handle it just fine. That's already the case, and isn't part of this issue. #424 updates the HTTP draft to highlight this, increasing the odds that implementations will test and support that case.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track that it might actually be desirable from a privacy standpoint for servers to pick arbitrary port numbers and perhaps even rotate them periodically (though that requires coordination with their Alt-Svc advertisements and lifetimes, which could be challenging) in order to make it more difficult for a network observer to classify traffic (and therefore more difficult to ossify).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as we're wrestling with in each of these privacy/manageability debates, removing easy network visibility into the likely protocol by using arbitrary port numbers means that middleboxes will probably resort to other means of attempting to identify protocols and potentially doing it badly, which could result in even worse ossification. (E.g. indexing into the TLS ClientHello to find the ALPN list, then panicking on a different handshake protocol.)\r\n\r\nThere's further discussion on the original issue, but this belongs in the ops drafts, not the protocol drafts.",

This seems like good operational advice for servers with enough traffic to build such anonymity sets (should they have interest in preventing client linkability, of course) -- small servers are probably out of luck though.\r\n\r\nApplicability should call this out as a problem, manageability should suggest a solution space.",

If it does so, it would be important that's it's both conformant to IETF specifications and have good performance.  This is the full L7 termination case, which is possible, but a lot of work, and we should heavily encourage anyone doing this to use an existing(\"good\") implementation.\r\n\r\nA potential MITM option is to attempt to terminate the handshake, but then only observe ApplicationData packets.  However, this could go wrong in many ways, so I believe it should be strongly discouraged.  QUIC is designed as an end-to-end protocol and efforts to change that are likely to end very poorly.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the length of the CID changes, then the offset of the header changes and a middlebox who doesn't track all CIDs both peers may be unable to decrypt packets.  I'm sure there are more gotchas, particularly with the introduction of extensions.  It may also be worth pointing out that QUIC frames are not TLV, so any frames(ie: extensions) that are not understood cause all other frames to be unparseable.\r\n\r\nThanks to @DavidSchinazi for the specific examples of ways this could fail.",

For example, client A and client B could share the same serverside address and port and the NAT can initially distinguish between the two because they have different CIDs.

The paper you link to here (from ICWET, and itself a decade old) primarily deals with the separation of good from bad flows at layer 7, not necessarily how the front-end handles these flows once classified. But you're definitely right that this is not *only* how it works: the DoS mitigation landscape is wide and varied (even if at the end of the day the only strategy we have found to work at scale is \"eat the DoS\".\r\n\r\nThat said, this text could be improved: it discounts detection and classification mechanisms other than based on flow designators derived from passive measurement, does not mention protocols other than IPFIX and the flow model that comes along with it when classifying traffic, etc. \r\n\r\nThe text should also be more applicable to UDP reflection DoS, which is a primary concern in wire image differentiation in QUIC (and which also isn't otherwise addressed in the document or in this issue). Adding a path-observable SYN cookie equivalent to QUIC, while useful, seems difficult to achieve given the working group's history of consensus about path-observable wire image features, so other classification mechanisms are what we'll be left with.\r\n\r\n",

While the infrastructure impact of QUIC is itself an intriguing research topic, DDoS affects not only transit networks but also the endpoints in ways that could not be prevented with any passive flow classification.",

Therefore, devices on path cannot alter any information or bits in QUIC packet headers, since alteration of header information will lead to a failed integrity check at the receiver, and can even lead to connection termination.\"\r\n\r\nThis isn't precise.

          "body": "The structure of the argument here is a bit stilted.\r\n\r\nYou want to start with the problem: UDP, middleboxes, short timers, connections become unusable.  Then, explain that QUIC provides PING, a mechanism that allows endpoints to test if a path is live and - where there are middleboxes with state that is refreshed by activity - keep any state in the path alive.\r\n\r\nThen you can say that this is extremely expensive if pinging is constant.  Mention bandwidth and also cost to battery-powered devices where maintaining an open radio channel is energy-intensive.\r\n\r\nNote then that it might be appropriate to limit use of keep-alives, but that will depend on application.  In HTTP, the recommendation is to only use them when there are outstanding requests.  At other times, allowing connections to time out or shutdown is preferable.  Then note that - with 0-RTT - the latency impact of opening a new connection is not that high.\r\n\r\nYou start and end with comments about keep-alives being application-specific.  That's not really the key point here.  You are simply trying to explain what the constraints are.  By making this your book-end statements, you shift a ton of emphasis onto the point, when it is really just a consequence of understanding the constraints you operate under.  Concentrate on documenting those constraints first and foremost, and then explain what options are available.",

Instead, applications which use QUIC can specify a port number to represent the combination of that application protocol and the QUIC transport, if desired.  Using the same port number that the application uses over TCP can be a useful mnemonic in some cases.",

          "body": "There's no mention of the QUIC Retry mechanism here. At the very least, for long header packets, a cooperating DDoS protection device can maintain a white-list of peer IP addresses, and only let through those addresses that successfully go through the Retry scenario.\r\n\r\nThe question then is what to do with short header packets. The backend server will not have any connection state for any junk short header packets, so the server should either quickly discard the packet silently or send a stateless reset if it happens to look like a valid QUIC packet. Assuming the short header packet traffic is enough to overwhelm the server, then this PR's text would come into play. Though it'd be interesting to see some perf numbers on what kind of CPU cost there is to just reject these packets. From my previous tests with the QUIC server running in the Windows kernel, the network was the limiting factor in these type of attacks, not the CPU. So if the network is the bottleneck, does it really matter if you drop it at the server or just in front of it?",

          "body": "@nibanks I think this section could be expanded a lot more, and Retry mechanism with a cooperating DDoS protection device definitely has a place. I am happy to give it a try in a different PR, or I can leave it to you, since you've likely thought more about this topic. The cooperation should include an agreement on the format of the Token to:\r\n1. For a Retry tokens generated by DDoS protection device, decode original_destination_connection_id.\r\n1. DDoS protection device to understand and validate server's token provided by a NEW_TOKEN frame\r\n1. DDoS protection device to understand and validate server's Retry tokens\r\n\r\nAs for the CPU cost, this consideration only comes into play, if the attack was allowed to reach backend servers.  Volumetric DDoS can saturate network links and/or be targeting networking infrastructure and not just backend servers.  As @britram is saying in #93, volumetric attacks are often mitigated further away from the edge of the network.  This kind of mitigation is the focus of UDP Policing section.",

(Servers still need to decrypt CID to decide it is invalid, and if the attacker is clever enough to establish one valid connection and use that CID in a flood, the server will also be decrypting packets.)  Retry does nothing to protect network resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR is about transparent boxes that try to mitigate volumetric attacks.",

It doesn't retransmit it because the keys are gone.  The observer won't see that; they only see the Handshake+ packet that is sent later.\r\n\r\nAnd if the client does discard keys too soon, the protocol doesn't stop working and no rules have been broken.\r\n\r\nI'm just asking that you be a little more careful and maybe say that a handshake will look like this *in most cases*.

Marking packets with different DSCP is likely to result in variations in order, delivery rate, and drop rate.  Using ECMP to distribute packets from a single flow across multiple network paths could produce similar effects.   These variations could adversely affect performance.\r\n\r\nThe improved feedback in QUIC relative to TCP might mean that QUIC is more able to tolerate variations in packet delivery.  There are also opportunities to deploy loss detection and congestion control algorithms that are more aware of these, but these algorithms do not currently exist.\r\n\r\nGetting differential treatment might be better served by using independent connections, but this has other effects, such as increased overheads and competing congestion control.",

Two points: first using _some kind of_ congestion control and recovery is not optional and all of these algorithms have to assume that all packets take the same path/get the same treat because otherwise you will need multiple congestion controller instances and that's not some we have in QUICv1. And second, algorithms do exist. TCP RACK is more re-ordering resilience and the time-based threshold in QUIC is as well. My assumption was/is also that they will more likely be implemented/used/deployed in QUIC than in TCP. \r\n\r\nHowever, we should probably see if we agree what we want to recommend. I think the right thing to recommend is that you should only use one DCSP with one QUIC connection and if you think you need more than one DCSP for your traffic, you should use multiple QUIC. Not sure if @martinthomson agrees to the second part?\r\n\r\nI was also trying to specifically focus this section on DCSP and EMCP (and not QoS in general to much - see new section title) because that the kind of questions I heart.",
